# Rick and Morty Test task Ackee

## Requirements

- ✅The app has to be written in Swift 
- ✅Define UI of the app however you like (we've heard that SwiftUI is some new thing now 😎) - floating NavBar was too painful to write for me 
- ✅Use any asynchronous framework you fancy like Combine, ReactiveSwift or native async/await-
- ✅Follow MVVM architecture or Composable architecture
- ✅The app should follow system Dark mode settings
- ❌Application should be able to run on every device and every orientation (however we don't have separate design for tablets) - was not able to do it in a nice way so I did not do it 
- ❌Use 3rd party libraries, technologies and frameworks as you wish. But have a good reason to use any of them, though.

- ✅ If you want to add anything extra, just go for it! (Psst, we ❤️ testing) - since you love testing, I added 2 easy Unit tests
- ✅ Have fun - I had... too much maybe 😌😇
